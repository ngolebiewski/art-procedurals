# Art Procedure Python "Sketches"

## About

In the spirit of drawing instructions from Sol LeWitt and chance operations of John Cage,
these are a series of stand-alone python programs that assist in the making of an artwork. 

## 0: die-for-painting.py

- Emulates the roll of a die. How many sides? You choose! 4, 6, 8, 12, 20...(talking a bow from D&D)
- Choose the number of rolls
- Select the colors that you'll use
---
- Use the output to make a painting, for example, each roll will be ascribed a color. and 
that number of squares could be filled in a grid. The result will look like a pixelated political map 
or a weird game of tetris.
